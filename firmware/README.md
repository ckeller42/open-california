# firmware — ESP32 satellite (#154)

ESP-IDF + NimBLE firmware for the camper-unit satellite. Work in progress: only the host-build
spike exists so far (`host/spike_main.c`, deleted once the real host target lands).

## Host build (`firmware/host`)

The CI end-to-end tests run the firmware's BLE code on Linux against the **upstream NimBLE Linux
port**, talking HCI over TCP to a Bumble virtual controller that shares a `LocalLink` with the repo's
fake unit (`tools/fake_unit_peripheral.py`). Harness: `tests/firmware/conftest.py`; CI job:
`firmware-host-e2e`.

```
firmware/host/fetch_nimble.sh      # clones the pinned NimBLE + Mbed TLS into firmware/host/_deps (gitignored)
make -C firmware/host cali-spike   # Linux only; needs a 32-bit toolchain (see below)
python -m pytest tests/firmware -v
```

## Pins

| What | Pin | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ESP-IDF | v6.1 (Task 8's `firmware-build`) | its `components/bt/host/nimble/nimble` submodule is esp-nimble `139cada0ae93` on branch `nimble-1.6.0-idf`, i.e. based on **upstream NimBLE 1.6.0** (merge base "Prepare for NimBLE 1.6.0 release") + ~440 Espressif commits |
| Upstream NimBLE (host build) | `nimble_1_10_0_tag` | **gap vs ESP-IDF: 1.6.0 → 1.10.0.** Upstream's TCP socket transport (`BLE_SOCK_USE_TCP`) is incomplete up to 1.9.0 — `ble_hci_sock_cmdevt_tx` (and, before 1.8.0, `ble_hci_sock_acl_tx`) exists only for the `linux_blue`/`nuttx` variants, so a 1.6.0–1.9.0 TCP build does not link (verified for 1.6.0: `undefined reference to ble_hci_sock_cmdevt_tx`). 1.10.0 is the first release whose `linux_tcp` choice is complete. The host API used here (GAP disc/connect, SM passkey, GATT client, `ble_store_config`) is unchanged across the gap. |
| Mbed TLS (host build) | `mbedtls-3.6.5` | NimBLE 1.10 dropped the bundled TinyCrypt; SM crypto needs Mbed TLS, and the build is 32-bit (below), so it is built from source — same version upstream NimBLE's port CI uses |

## Host build notes (every NimBLE / Bumble adaptation)

1. **32-bit build.** NimBLE's `porting/nimble/Makefile.defs` forces `-m32` ("places in NimBLE assume
   4-byte pointers"); the ESP32-S3 is 32-bit too, so we keep it. CI installs `gcc-multilib
   g++-multilib`. On a non-x86 Linux (e.g. Docker on Apple silicon) cross-build with
   `CROSS_COMPILE=i686-linux-gnu-` and run the binary through qemu-i386 binfmt.
2. **Mbed TLS from source, static.** A 32-bit `libmbedtls-dev` is not installable on stock
   Ubuntu, so `fetch_nimble.sh` clones Mbed TLS and the Makefile builds `libmbed{tls,x509,crypto}.a`
   with `-m32` (headers from the same tree, not the system's).
3. **syscfg.** `host/syscfg/syscfg.h` is the 1.10 example's `syscfg.h` with exactly these changes:
   `BLE_SOCK_TYPE__linux_blue 0`, `BLE_SOCK_TYPE__linux_tcp 1`, `BLE_SM_BONDING 1`, `BLE_SM_SC 1`,
   `BLE_SM_MITM 1`, `BLE_SM_IO_CAP BLE_HS_IO_KEYBOARD_ONLY`, `BLE_SM_OUR_KEY_DIST 0x07`,
   `BLE_SM_THEIR_KEY_DIST 0x07`. NimBLE includes `"syscfg/syscfg.h"`, so the include path lists
   `firmware/host` itself (not `firmware/host/syscfg`) **before** the example's include dir.
4. **Init order (1.10).** `nimble_port_init()` already runs `ble_transport_ll_init()` →
   `ble_hci_sock_init()`, which connects to `127.0.0.1:<port>` — so `ble_hci_sock_set_device(port)`
   must come first, and the Bumble TCP server must already listen. The socket transport's RX queue
   needs its own thread (`ble_hci_sock_ack_handler`); the host runs `nimble_port_run()` on the main
   thread. The bond store is `ble_store_config_init()` (1.10; RAM-only here).
5. **Bumble: legacy advertising reports.** Bumble's `Controller` answers even a legacy scan
   (`HCI_LE_Set_Scan_Enable`, what NimBLE sends with `BLE_EXT_ADV=0`) with LE *Extended*
   Advertising Reports while it advertises the `LE_EXTENDED_ADVERTISING` feature; NimBLE ignores
   those and never sees the unit. The harness clears that feature bit on the firmware-side
   controller (a real controller reports in the format of the scan command used).
6. **Bumble: public-address links.** Bumble's `LocalLink` stamps every LE ACL packet with the
   sender controller's `random_address`, even when the host connected with its public address. The
   harness gives the firmware-side controller a public address (Bumble defaults to `00:00:00:00:00:00`,
   which NimBLE treats as "no public address") and mirrors it, typed PUBLIC, into `random_address`.
7. **Pairing.** The fake unit refuses Just Works, so the host pairs as KEYBOARD_ONLY + MITM + SC; the
   unit displays the passkey (`FakeUnit.next_passkey()`), the test types it on the firmware's stdin.
   A wrong passkey ends in SMP Pairing Failed (confirm value failed) → `FAIL enc_change 1284`.
